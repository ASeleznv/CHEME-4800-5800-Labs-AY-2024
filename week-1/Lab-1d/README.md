# `Lab 1d` Working with the Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), and the Julia, Python Interactive REPLs
The objetive of `Lab 1d` is to get familiar with the Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), i.e., tne terminal window in `VSCode` and the Julia, Python Interactive REPLs (Run-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
* Motivation: Why do we need to care about the command line in the age of Windows, Mac, and Linux GUIs (graphical user interfaces)? 

Many technical computing tasks are best done from the command line. For example, you may want to run a program 24/7 on a remote machine, or you may want to run a program on a supercomputer. In these cases, you will need to use the command line. I use the command all day everyday, and I think you will find it useful too.

## `Lab 1d` Topics
* `VSCode` terminal window: you can start the `VSCode` terminal window by clicking on the `Terminal` menu item and then selecting `New Terminal` or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+~`. This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the `VSCode` window. 

* You can type commands into the terminal window and press `Enter` to execute them. You can also use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous commands. You can also use the mouse to select text in the terminal window. You can copy and paste text into the terminal window using the standard keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`. You can also use the mouse to copy and paste text into the terminal window. 

* The terminal window is a `shell` of some sort, e.g., `zsh` for me. A `shell` is a command line interpreter. It listens for commands from the keyboard and executes them. The shell is the interface between you and the operating system. The shell is a program like any other program. You can run other programs from the shell.
