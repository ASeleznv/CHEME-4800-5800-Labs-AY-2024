# `Lab 1b` Installation of the CHEME 4800/5800 Toolchain (Anaconda, VSCode, Julia, GitHub, etc.)

## Overview
This lab will walk you through the CHEME 4800/5800 toolchain installation. This toolchain includes the following software (all of which are free and open source):

* [Julia](https://julialang.org) - a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language that we'll use in the course (along with [Python](https://www.python.org) and other languages such as [C/C++]()) to demonstrate  concepts in computational engineering.
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - a graphical user interface for the [Git](https://git-scm.com) version control system. We'll use GitHub Desktop to manage the code that we write in the course.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - a code editor that supports various programming languages and file formats. We'll use VSCode to write and edit code in the course.
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - a Python distribution that includes the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interactive development notebook environments.

## Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

### Installing Julia
This course uses the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. You can find the installation instructions for Julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/). 
* On `Windows`, please check the `Add Julia to Path` checkbox during installation. This will allow you to run Julia from the command line.
* On `MacOS`, please follow the instructions to add Julia to your path found [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#macos). This will allow you to run Julia from the command line.

### Installing GitHub Desktop
This course uses [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage our code. You can find the installation instructions for GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com). 

### Installing Visual Studio Code
This course uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as a code editor. You can find the installation instructions for Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
* Once you install Visual Studio Code, you must install the [Julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org) for Visual Studio Code. You can find the installation instructions for the Julia extension [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/gettingstarted/).
* you'll also need to install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for Visual Studio Code. You can find the installation instructions for the Python extension [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

### Installing Anaconda
This course uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as a Python distribution. You can find the installation instructions for Anaconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). If you still need a Python installation on your machine, we recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your machine.  Once you have installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), you can install the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package, which will allow you to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) with [Julia](https://julialang.org).
